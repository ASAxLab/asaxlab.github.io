Evacuating buildings during emergencies such as fires or terrorist attacks requires heightened environmental awareness, quick decision-making, and immediate action. This project proposes EvacAware, a practical evacuation assistance system designed to enhance situation awareness for evacuation teams via a mobile application. With EvacAware, team leaders gain real-time awareness of critical factors, such as environmental hazards, evacuation procedures, and requests for additional assistance.

EvacAware primarily aims to enhance the situational awareness of evacuation teams, composed of multiple leaders and support a coordinated evacuation. To achieve this, a team situation awareness module is integrated into the system. Additionally, a comprehensive sensory infrastructure is proposed to collect real-time environmental data, recognize situational contexts, and determine users' indoor positions within the building. Advanced data analysis techniques are employed to predict situations, assess risks, and improve overall understanding of both the environment and user conditions. This enables the system to provide the evacuation team with real-time environmental insights and actionable recommendations.

Both evacuation leaders (teams) and building occupants can use the application. Occupants can inform evacuation leaders about their status and, when necessary, be tracked by the leaders. The mobile app is designed to minimize information overload and maintain a user-friendly interface, even in high-stress situations.

The app focuses on evacuating large buildings with numerous occupants, such as schools, business centers, hospitals, airports, train stations, and shopping malls, during emergencies. EvacAware can function as a comprehensive system across different buildings, allowing users to operate a single mobile application for all EvacAware-integrated facilities.
