... action selection for autonomous systems is a challanging task and focus of this project. 
Decision making and action selection incorporate decreasing situational risks and maintain safety as operational constraints. 
Commonly, neither existing safety standards nor the situation modeling or knowledge representation is considered in that context.

The awareness emerges from relating knowledge about the environment, human goals, and objectives. Accordingly, the SAc will mimic this process artificially through a novel integration of four functional modules responsible for perception, situation recognition, intention recognition, and projection. 
The SAc outputs a situation-action space considering the user preferences, goals, and intentions used as input for decision-making.

The project aims for both short-term scientific and long-term industrial and societal impact. It is revealed as a human assistance system prototype for complex situations. 
In addition, it has concrete contributions to artificial situation awareness to be published in academic venues covering human-computer interaction, situation awareness, and AR games. 
The most immediate societal impact of the developed SAc will probably be embedded in persuasive technologies for reaching long-term behavioral change for individuals and society in the areas of healthcare, safety, and climate change.
