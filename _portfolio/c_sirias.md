... action selection for autonomous systems is a challanging task and focus of this project. 
Decision making and action selection incorporate decreasing situational risks and maintain safety as operational constraints. 
Commonly, neither existing safety standards nor the situation modeling or knowledge representation is considered in that context.

This project investigates and applies novel approaches related to Safety-Driven Behavior Management for different applications like unmanned aerial systes or automated driving. The focus lies mainly on situation modeling, and the problem of knowledge representation in the context of situational risks. 
One of the research questions is whether the safety standards-oriented hazards analysis and the risk assessment approach can be combined with the machine learning-based situation recognition.
