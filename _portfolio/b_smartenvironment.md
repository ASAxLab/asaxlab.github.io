The project aims to explore the use of machine learning and IoT technologies to recognize and analyze human activities in real time. By leveraging ambient IoT devices such as wearable and portable devices, radar, camera systems, and advanced AI models, the project seeks to develop intelligent systems that can support applications such as health monitoring, smart home automation, workplace safety, and personalized assistance. This research will provide actionable insights into human behavior, enable proactive interventions, and contribute to the design of more responsive, interactive, and adaptive environments.
