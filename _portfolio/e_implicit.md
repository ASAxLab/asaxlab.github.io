In this dedicated project, our aim is to bolster artificial situation awareness by delving into the realm of implicit object relationships. While explicit relationships between objects are often readily discernible, it is the implicit connections that often hold the key to a deeper understanding of complex situations. Our research focuses on developing algorithms and methodologies to uncover these subtle links, thereby enriching the perception capabilities of AI systems.

Using a combination of machine learning techniques, data analysis, and contextual understanding, we embark on a comprehensive investigation.
