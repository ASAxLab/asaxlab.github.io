Autonomous or semi-autonomous systems are used in different application domains to simplify or assist human tasks. 
In this context, their behavior has to be verifiably safe. This project focuses on techniques for specifying and designing a supervisory safety unit to ensure the overall system's safe behavior. 
This includes methods for run-time risk area generation and adjustment, situational hazard analysis and risk assessment, run-time technical system reliability assessment, and emergency behavior modeling are investigated.
