Situation Awareness-based Attention Guidance (SAAG) is aimed at developing a novel Situation Awareness component (SAc) for an Attention Guidance system to improve human situation awareness in complex environments and tasks. 
The SAAG system, with a focus on SAc, is realized and evaluated for the players of an Augmented Reality (AR) tabletop game. Situation awareness is crucial for decision-making and action-taking.

The awareness emerges from relating knowledge about the environment, human goals, and objectives. Accordingly, the SAc will mimic this process artificially through a novel integration of four functional modules responsible for perception, situation recognition, intention recognition, and projection. 
The SAc outputs a situation-action space considering the user preferences, goals, and intentions used as input for decision-making.

This project builds on components which are currently developed in the context of the Augmented Attention (AA) project run by the forer Egocentric Interaction (EI) research group at Malmö University.

The project aims for both short-term scientific and long-term industrial and societal impact. It is revealed in the form of a human assistance system prototype for complex situations. 
In addition, it has concrete contributions to artificial situation awareness to be published in academic venues covering human-computer interaction, situation awareness, and AR games. 
The most immediate societal impact of the developed SAc will probably be embedded in persuasive technologies for reaching long-term behavioural change, for individuals and society, in the areas of healthcare, safety, and climate change.
