Situation Awareness-based Attention Guidance (SAAG) aims to develop a novel Situation Awareness component (SAc) for an Attention Guidance system to improve human situation awareness in complex environments and tasks. 
The Situation Awareness-based Attention Guidance (SAAG) system, focusing on SAc, is realized and evaluated for the players of an Augmented Reality (AR) tabletop game. Situation awareness is crucial for decision-making and action-taking.
