Situation Awareness-based Attention Guidance (SAAG) aims to develop a novel Situation Awareness component (SAc) for an Attention Guidance system to improve human situation awareness in complex environments and tasks. 
The Situation Awareness-based Attention Guidance (SAAG) system, focusing on SAc, is realized and evaluated for the players of an Augmented Reality (AR) tabletop game. Situation awareness is crucial for decision-making and action-taking.

The awareness emerges from relating knowledge about the environment, human goals, and objectives. Accordingly, the SAc will mimic this process artificially through a novel integration of four functional modules responsible for perception, situation recognition, intention recognition, and projection. 
The SAc outputs a situation-action space considering the user preferences, goals, and intentions used as input for decision-making.

The project aims for both short-term scientific and long-term industrial and societal impact. It is revealed as a human assistance system prototype for complex situations. 
In addition, it has concrete contributions to artificial situation awareness to be published in academic venues covering human-computer interaction, situation awareness, and AR games. 
The most immediate societal impact of the developed SAc will probably be embedded in persuasive technologies for reaching long-term behavioral change for individuals and society in the areas of healthcare, safety, and climate change.
