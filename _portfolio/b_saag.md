Evacuating the buildings during various emergencies, such as fire or terrorist attacks, requires high awareness of the environment, quick decision-making, and immediate action. 
This project aims to design a practical evacuation assistance system for evacuation leaders to improve their situation awareness in emergencies through a mobile application. 
Furthermore, a proof of concept is considered a part of this project. Using the proposed system, the leaders will be aware of their situations in real-time, such as environmental hazards, evacuation procedures, extra assistance requests.

Accordingly, a proper sensory infrastructure will be proposed to support indoor positioning in the building. This system's primary goal is to improve the situation awareness of an evacuation team which composed of several individual evacuation leaders. 
Accordingly, a team situation awareness module will be proposed as a part of assistance system.

However, both evacuation leaders and occupants can be users of the application. The occupants can use the application to inform the evacuation leaders about their status and be tracked by the leaders if it is necessary. 
The focus of this application is the evacuation of buildings with large spaces and large numbers of occupants, such as schools, business buildings, and shopping malls, in emergencies.
