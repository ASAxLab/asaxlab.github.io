The project investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to analyse travel behaviour patterns among specific social groups. It also evaluates the impact of interventions and policy changes on mobility. While testing a proof of concept, the project aims to deliver actionable insights that inform policy and support more sustainable transport systems.
