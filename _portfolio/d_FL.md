The project aims to investigate and develop federated and privacy-preserving machine learning methods that allow multiple devices or organizations to collaboratively train AI models without sharing raw data. By leveraging techniques such as federated learning, secure aggregation, differential privacy, and edge AI, the project seeks to support applications in areas such as smart environments, healthcare, mobility, public safety, and organizational analytics. The ultimate goal is to enable trustworthy, scalable, and privacy-aware AI systems that respect data ownership, regulatory constraints, and ethical principles.
